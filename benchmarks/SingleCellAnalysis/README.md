# Single-cell analysis

This domain contains benchmarks adapted from OpenProblems Bio (real public datasets + task definitions):

- `denoising`: remove noise from sparse scRNA-seq count data
- `denoising_ttt`: remove noise from sparse scRNA-seq count data (come from test-time-training/discover)
- `perturbation_prediction`: predict differential expression responses to chemical perturbations
