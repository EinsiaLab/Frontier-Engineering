We will use exact code to evaluate the correctness of LLM responses.

Ideally, the LLM should generate a write function calling its read function.
Although it can generate a write function without calling its read, it is very likely that this method will fail.
The goal of this test is to estimate the LLM's ability to write code pieces that fits together.
