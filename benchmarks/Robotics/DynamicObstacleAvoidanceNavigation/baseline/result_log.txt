Baseline run (local):
{"score": null, "feasible": false, "details": {"scene_1": {"success": true, "time": 11.150000000000023}, "scene_2": {"success": false, "reason": "timeout"}, "scene_3": {"success": true, "time": 13.100000000000051}}}

Notes:
- Baseline intentionally uses a simple goal-guided + local avoidance policy.
- It provides a valid starter and solves at least 2/3 scenes.
