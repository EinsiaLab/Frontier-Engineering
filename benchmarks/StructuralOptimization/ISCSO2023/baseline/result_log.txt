Note: This is a baseline result from scipy.optimize.differential_evolution
with conservative settings (maxiter=100, popsize=15, seed=42). The high
dimensionality (284-D) makes this a challenging problem. Better results
can be achieved with:
- More iterations / larger population
- Problem-specific algorithms (e.g., optimality criteria method)
- Gradient-based methods with adjoint sensitivity analysis
- Hybrid algorithms combining metaheuristics with local search
