# WirelessChannelSimulation

This domain focuses on reliability evaluation for digital communication under noisy channels.
The current task targets BER estimation in a rare-event setting.

## Subtasks

- `HighReliableSimulation/`: implement a custom `MySampler` for Hamming(127,120) over AWGN and estimate BER with variance control under fixed evaluation settings.
