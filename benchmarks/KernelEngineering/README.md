# Kernel Engineering

This task originates from https://github.com/test-time-training/discover and includes two subtasks: MLA and TriMul.

The task involves writing highly optimized low-level GPU kernel code for specific tensor computation tasks, with the goal of making the code run faster than handwritten code by top human CUDA engineers on specific hardware (such as NVIDIA H100, A100, or AMD MI300X).
